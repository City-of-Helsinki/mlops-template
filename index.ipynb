    "\n",
    "A pipe operator takes the expression before it and gives it as the first argument to the expression after it,\n",

    "They either perform a transformation or a side-effect, but never both.\n",

    "In a transformation a modified copy of the input is returned.\n",

    "```\n",
    "although you can use pipeable functions in either way, or as a composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Piped code is easy to read: you see that a model class is initialized, fitted with certain hyperparameters, a prediction is made and aggregated to a mean.\n",

    "3. **Embrace functional programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not a functional programming language, but it can be written in functional style.\n",
    "Many of the concepts can be used to write cleaner data code with Python. \n",
    "The key concepts of functional programming include pure functions, immutability and higher order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pure Functions do not have side effects, meaning that they do not change the state of the program. Output of a pure function depends only on it's input.\n",
    "* Immutability means that data cannot be changed after creation. Changes can only be made to a copy of the data.\n",
    "* Higher order functions are functions that may accept other functions as parameters or return new functions. This allows high level of abstractation.\n",

    "In the data notebook, the the data is loaded and cleaned, and a basic analysis may be carried out.\n",

    "**Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model notebook, the machine learning model (or analytics or simulation) is explored, defined and tested.\n",
    "You can begin with scripting, but based on the script you should develop real generalizable and tested code.\n",

    "With the help of this notebook, you can create workflows to automatically update, train and deploy your ML model.\n",

    "The files contain instructions for minimum required edits.\n",
    "You can continue editing them in the future, so no need to worry about getting it right the first time.\n",
    "These are used for building the python modules and docs based on your notebooks.\n",
    "If you get errors when building a module or docs, take a look again at these files.\n",

    "    git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Save your notebooks and call `nbdev_build_docs` to create doc pages based on your notebooks (see below).\n",
    "This will also create README.md file based on this notebook.\n",
